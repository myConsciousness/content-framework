# Content Framework

## What is it?

**_Makes your code more flexible to changes._**

`Content Framework` was designed and created with the goal of creating a large amount of code that is flexible enough to respond to changes in value and behavioral specifications in the source code.

The `content file` used by `Content Framework` are JSON-based, intuitive and easy to read structures. Content files allow you to define options of values and conditions for retrieving options.

As a framework each procedure is designed to be easy to perform, and the implementation is optimized to be very light and fast.

## Benefits

- Be more flexible code for specification changes
- Possible to reuse common values and behaviors defined as content and rules
- Possible to change the behavior without changing the source code directly
